# MONOPOLY-MD-Lazarus-Delphie
Hello I am a German Highschool  student. In this semster i started to create a graphic monopoly game as finale project for informaitcs. Required to use Delphie is used lazarus to set up graphical play board with a functional datastructure as back end. The basic idea is to change constantly the main data array play and Update the changes graphically.
The hole game is still very messy basic functions for example trading of streets  or community and chest fields are not implemented to this point. In the case i would start the project again, i would invest even more time into structuring and planning the game play before  startung to program. 
If you are intressted take the game and code and make your own game with it. I did the game after the Version for the City Magdeburg in Germany, but you can use photoshop to create your own cards for a individual version. 
Your are welcome to use it open source. I would be happy to see your imporvements of the game.
