# MONOPOLY-MD-Lazarus-Delphie
Hello I am a German Highschool  student. In this semster i started to create a graphic monopoly game as finale project for informaitcs.
Required to use Delphie i used lazarus to set up a graphical game board together with a functional datastructure.
The basic idea is to change constantly the main data array "play" and Update the changes to the  graphic game board. 

The hole game is still very messy basic functions for example trading of streets  or community and chest fields are not implemented
to this point. In the case i would start the project again, i would invest even more time into structuring and planning the game play
before  startung to program. 

If you are intressted take the game and code and make your own game with it. I did the game after the Version for the City Magdeburg in Germany, but you can use photoshop to create your own cards for a individual version. 
Your are welcome to use it open source. I would be happy to see your imporvements of the game.
